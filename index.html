    <p>
        I am a mathematics student with a strong interest in pure mathematics.
        I am currently pursuing my master’s degree in mathematics at the
        Indian Institute of Technology Delhi.
    </p>

    <p>
        My academic interests lie primarily in mathematical research and
        theoretical aspects of the subject, particularly in areas such as
        number theory, algebra, and analysis. I am especially drawn to problems
        that emphasize structure, rigor, and conceptual elegance.
    </p>

    <p>
        This website serves as a personal academic homepage and contains
        information about my education, research interests, academic activities,
        and occasional mathematical writing.
