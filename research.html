    Areas of interest and thematic directions of my academic work.

<section class="card content">

    <p>
        My research interests lie in pure mathematics, with a primary focus on
        number theory. Within number theory, I am drawn to questions related to transcendence,
        Diophantine problems, and the interaction of number theoretic functions with analytic
        methods. I am also interested in related areas of algebra and analysis
        that naturally connect to these themes.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am broadly motivated by foundational and conceptual aspects of
        mathematics, and I am keen on developing a deeper understanding of
        abstract structures and their underlying principles.
