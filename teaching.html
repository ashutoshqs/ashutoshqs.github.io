    Teaching roles and instructional experience in mathematics.

    <p>
        I have been involved in teaching activities as a Teaching Assistant
        for undergraduate mathematics courses.
        My responsibilities have included conducting tutorial sessions,
        assisting with problem-solving sessions, and providing academic
        support to students.
    </p>

    <p>
        Through these activities, I have gained experience in communicating
        mathematical ideas clearly and rigorously, particularly in a classroom
        and small-group setting.
